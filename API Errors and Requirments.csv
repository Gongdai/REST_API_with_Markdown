Top 3 REST API Bugs:,,

,,
Top 3 Use Cases,,
"1. Present Trigger Daignosis API detailly, provide coding sample on online-help. According to the gigantic input body, we 'd better provide a fully Input Body structure, let users to only need to follow our stucture sample and put in their attribute values directly. ",,
"2. Present Get One-Ip table API detailly, provide coding sample on online-help. Improve the explaination for each input parameter. The API documant on Swagger have errors.",,

,,
New or Deleted API Requirements,,

      1a. Delete Device Group API.
      1b. Get All Device Group API.
      1c. Update Devices in Device Group API.",,

,,
New Issues,,
"1. As a netbrain user with a domian admin privilege, when calling get tenant and get domain API, user can only retrive the value of tenant ID but no domain ID, that is strange, if the user cannot get both of them, user cannot specify a working domain by calling API.(Bug reported)",,
"2. User with “Engineer” role, can check all site information from GUI but when calling get site information API the response shows ""permission error"" that is not reasonable.",,
"3. Calling trigger diagnosis API with Path map, only show devices in map, no other informations",,
4.privilege 由 框架 区分。,,
5. statuscode response，http success or functional success,,
"6. Calculate path API and trigger path API should return same response, (trigger should return a json of hoplist also)   
      6a. Get path result API, if the respose is failed, an explanation of failed reason should be provided in response also.
      6b. Trigger path API, can parse runbook input variables from API calling input json body.(gigantic devices number from Keith).
             And when we set the stub as on-demand, when customer open the returned url directly by copy paste to browser, the runbook pre-set in stub would be deleted.
             Unless click the map link in ""API Triggered Tasks"" first to trigger the pre-set runbook running. That is not reasonable.",,
"7. Roles and Privileges Table not accuracy, some number doesn't exist, some numbers not only correspond to one privilege, table not full cover the privilege information provided in UI Roles.",,
